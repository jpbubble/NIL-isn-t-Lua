# Syntax highlighters

Syntax highlighters are always welcome. However I am already busy enough as it is, and there are tons of IDEs out there. So if you have a syntax highlighter for an IDE I don't know about, just throw in a pull request, and describe well for which editor your highlighter is, and how to install it. 

Oh yeah, it goes without saying, but syntax highlighters for this repository will have to be about NIL only (a combination set of files to cover both Lua and NIL is acceptable if that IDE doesn't have a good Lua highligher yet).

If you've created a highlighter and the IDE in question as its own add-on management to cover it (like Atom, vscode and Visual Studio, to name a few), you may upload it to those systems in stead (may even be better), but I'd be happy if you'd throw in a file in md format to be posted on this repository, so the rest of us know ;)
